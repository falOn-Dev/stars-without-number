# üåê World Tag: Cheap Life

## Description
Human life is near-worthless on this world. Ubiquitous cloning, local conditions that ensure early death, a culture that reveres murder, or a social structure that utterly discounts the value of most human lives ensures that death is the likely outcome for any action that irritates someone consequential.
## Enemies
- Master assassin
- Bloody-handed judge
- Overseer of disposable clones

## Friends
- Endearing local whose life the PCs accidentally bought
- Escapee from death seeking outside help
- Reformer trying to change local mores

## Complications
- Radiation or local diseases ensure all locals die before twenty-five years of age
- Tech ensures that death is just an annoyance
- Locals are totally convinced of a blissful afterlife

## Things
- Device that revives or re-embodies the dead
- Maltech engine fueled by human life
- Priceless treasure held by a now-dead owner

## Places
- Thronging execution ground
- extremely cursory cemetery
- Factory full of lethal dangers that could be corrected easily
