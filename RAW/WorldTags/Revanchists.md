# üåê World Tag: Revanchists

## Description
The locals formerly owned another world, or a major nation on the planet formerly owned an additional region of land. Something happened to take away this control or drive out the former rulers, and they‚Äôve never forgotten it. The locals are obsessed with reclaiming their lost lands, and will allow no questions of practicality to interfere with their cause.

- Politician seeking to use the resentment for their own ends
- Local convinced the PCs are agents of the ‚Äúthieving‚Äù power
- Refugee from the land bitterly demanding it be reclaimed

## Friends
- Realist local clergy seeking peace
- Politician trying to calm the public
- Third-party diplomat trying to stamp out the fire

## Complications

- Both sides have seized lands the other thinks are theirs

## Things

- Relic carried out of it
- Proof that the land claim is justified or unjustified
