# üåê World Tag: Robots

## Description
The world has a great many robots on it. Most bots are going to be non-sentient expert systems, though an AI with enough computing resources can control many bots at once, and some worlds may have developed VIs to a degree that individual bots can seem (or be) sentient. Some worlds might even be ruled by metal overlords, ones which do not need to be sentient so long as they have overwhelming force.
