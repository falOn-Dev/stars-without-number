# 🌐 World Tag: Taboo Treasure

## Description
The natives here produce something that is both fabulously valuable and strictly forbidden elsewhere in the sector. It may be a lethally addictive drug, forbidden gengineering tech, vat-grown “perfect slaves”, or a useful substance that can only be made through excruciating human suffering. This treasure is freely traded on the world, but bringing it elsewhere is usually an invitation to a long prison stay or worse.
