# 🌐 World Tag: Holy War

## Description
A savage holy war is raging on this world, either between factions of locals or as a united effort against the pagans of some neighboring world. This war might involve a conventional religion, or it might be the result of a branding campaign, political ideology, artistic movement, or any other cause that people use as a substitute for traditional religion.
## Enemies
- Blood-mad pontiff
- Coldly cynical secular leader
- Totalitarian political demagogue

## Friends
- Desperate peacemaker
- Hard-pressed refugee of the fighting
- Peaceful religious leader who lost the internal debate

## Complications
- The targets of the war really are doing something diabolically horrible
- The holy war is just a mask for a very traditional casus belli
- The leaders don’t want the war won but only prolonged
- Both this world and the target of the war are religion-obsessed

## Things
- Sacred relic of the faith
- A captured blasphemer under a death sentence
- Plunder seized in battle

## Places
- Massive holy structure
- Razed community of infidels
- Vast shrine to the martyrs dead in war
