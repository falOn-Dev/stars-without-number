# 🌐 World Tag: Pretech Cultists

## Description
The capacities of human science before the Silence vastly outmatch the technology available since the Scream. The Jump Gates alone were capable of crossing hundreds of light years in a moment, and they were just one example of the results won by blending psychic artifice with pretech science. Some worlds outright worship the artifacts of their ancestors, seeing in them the work of more enlightened and perfect humanity. These cultists may or may not understand the operation or replication of these devices, but they seek and guard them jealously.
