# üåê World Tag: Maneaters

## Description
The locals are cannibals, either out of necessity or out of cultural preference. Some worlds may actually eat human flesh, while others simply require the rendering of humans into important chemicals or pharmaceutical compounds, perhaps to prolong the lives of ghoul overlords. This cannibalism plays a major role in their society.
