## Description
The world is doomed, and the locals may or may not know it. Some cosmic catastrophe looms before them, and the locals have no realistic way to get everyone to safety. To the extent that the public is aware, society is disintegrating into a combination of religious fervor, abject hedonism, and savage violence.

- Offworld relief coordinator
- Harried law officer

## Complications
- The doom is false or won‚Äôt actually kill everyone
- The doom was intentionally triggered by someone

## Things

- A cache of priceless cultural artifacts
- The life savings of someone trying to buy passage out
- Data that would prove to the public the end is nigh

## Places
- Open square beneath a sky angry with a foretaste of th impending ruin
- Orgiastic celebration involving sex and murder in equal parts
