## Hooks or Leads

- - **The Empty Bunks:** Davidâ€™s quarters have three empty beds â€” reminders of his lost team. He begs the PCs to at least recover their tags for burial.  
- **Damaged Gear Cache:** The partyâ€™s artificer has repaired *Sarnâ€™s Rifle* â€” a TL3 laser longarm (+1 to hit, custom sight). David provides a partial cave map, one working beacon (limited range), and two glow markers.  
- **The Ghost Signal:** David recalls a single faint beacon ping before he blacked out. Its partial coordinates suggest a lead deeper in the tunnels.  
- **Coordinated Swarm:** David recalls strange behavior from the glyphids, they seemed organized and strategic, rather than animalistic. Even waiting for his team to enter the perfect ambush spot to attack


## Hidden Agendas

- The mineral that's been discovered and targeted by the GMC is being used by a hidden research sect within the company trying to control the glyphids, turning them into war machines
