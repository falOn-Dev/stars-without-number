## 📜 Description  

Sarn’s Legacy is a massive, dwarven-made kinetic rifle designed for mining rescue operations. Its brutal, industrial design sacrifices elegance for indestructibility. The weapon is blocky and scarred, with a reinforced stock worn smooth by years of use. Maker’s marks from ancient dwarven gunsmiths adorn the breach, a reminder of a time when tools were built for eternity.  

It hums faintly when loaded, the grav-fed magazine locking into place with a satisfying clunk. The rifle is heavy in the hand — a miner’s lifeline against rock, ruin, and swarm.

## 🏛 Lore / History  

This rifle belonged to Sarn Thollik of Rescue Team 3 — one of Grahslagg’s finest mining rescue squads. Sarn used it to blast through collapsed tunnels and fight off swarms during countless missions. The weapon bears the scars of Glyphid acid, rockfalls, and desperate last stands.  

The rifle’s name is not ceremonial; it *is* Sarn’s legacy — passed on by the only survivor of his final mission, David Garbulder, to those who would continue the fight.
