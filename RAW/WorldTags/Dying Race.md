# üåê World Tag: Dying Race

## Description
The inhabitants of this world are dying out, and they know it. Through environmental toxins, hostile bio-weapons, or sheer societal despair, the culture cannot replenish its numbers. Members seek meaning in their own strange goals or peculiar faiths, though a few might struggle to find some way to reverse their slow yet inevitable doom.
## Enemies
- Hostile outsider who wants the locals dead
- Offworlder seeking to take advantage of their weakened state
- Invaders eager to push the locals out of their former lands

## Friends
- One of the few youth among the population
- Determined and hopeful reformer
- Researcher seeking a new method of reproduction

## Complications
- The dying culture‚Äôs values were monstrous
- The race‚Äôs death is somehow necessary to prevent some grand catastrophe
- The race is somehow convinced they deserve this fate

## Things
- Extremely valuable reproductive tech
- Treasured artifacts of the former age
- Bioweapon used on the race

## Places
- City streets devoid of pedestrians
- Mighty edifice now crumbling with disrepair
- Small dwelling full of people in a town now otherwise empty
