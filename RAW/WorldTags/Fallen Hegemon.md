# üåê World Tag: Fallen Hegemon

## Description
At some point in the past, this world was a hegemonic power over some or all of the sector, thanks to superior tech, expert diplomacy, the weakness of their neighbors, or inherited Mandate legitimacy. Some kind of crash or revolt broke their power, however, and now the world is littered with the wreckage of former glory.
## Enemies
- Bitter pretender to a meaningless throne
- Resentful official dreaming of empire
- Vengeful offworlder seeking to punish their old rulers

## Friends
- Realistic local leader trying to hold things together
- Scholar of past glories
- Refugee from an overthrown colonial enclave

## Complications
- The hegemon‚Äôs rule was enlightened and fair
- It collapsed due to its own internal strife rather than external resistance
- It pretends that nothing has happened to its power
- It‚Äôs been counter-colonized by vengeful outsiders

## Things
- Precious insignia of former rule
- Relic tech important to its power
- Plundered colonial artifact

## Places
- Palace far too grand for its current occupant
- Oversized spaceport now in disrepair
- Boulevard lined with monuments to past glories
