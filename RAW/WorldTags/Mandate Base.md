# 🌐 World Tag: Mandate Base

## Description
The Terran Mandate retained its control over this world for much longer than usual, and the world may still consider itself a true inheritor of Mandate legitimacy. Most of these worlds have or had superior technology, but they may still labor under the burden of ancient restrictive tech or monitoring systems designed to prevent them from rebelling.
## Enemies
- Deranged Mandate monitoring AI
- Aspiring sector ruler
- Demagogue preaching local superiority over “traitorous rebel worlds”.

## Friends
- Idealistic do-gooder local
- Missionary for advanced Mandate tech
- Outsider seeking lost data from Mandate records

## Complications
- The monitoring system forces the locals to behave in aggressive ways toward “rebel” worlds
- The monitoring system severely hinders offworld use of their tech
- The original colonists are all dead and have been replaced by outsiders who don’t understand all the details

## Things
- Ultra-advanced pretech
- Mandate military gear
- Databank containing precious tech schematics

## Places
- Faded Mandate offices still in use
- Vault containing ancient pretech
- Carefully-maintained monument to Mandate glory
