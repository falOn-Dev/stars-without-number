# üåê World Tag: Nomads

## Description
Most of the natives of this world are nomadic, usually following a traditional cycle of movement through the lands they possess. Promises of rich plunder or local environmental perils can force these groups to strike out against neighbors. Other groups are forced to move constantly due to unpredictable dangers that crop up on the planet.
