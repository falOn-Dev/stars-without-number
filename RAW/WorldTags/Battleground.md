# üåê World Tag: Battleground

## Description
The world is a battleground for two or more outside powers. They may be interstellar rivals, or groups operating out of orbitals or other system bodies. Something about the planet is valuable enough for them to fight over, but the natives are too weak to be anything but animate obstacles to the fight.
## Enemies
- Ruthless military commander
- Looter pack chieftain
- Traitorous collaborator

## Friends
- Native desperately seeking protection
- Pragmatic military officer
- Hapless war orphan

## Complications
- The war just ended as both sides are leaving
- The natives somehow brought this on themselves
- A small group of natives profit tremendously from the fighting

## Things
- A cache of the resource the invaders seek
- Abandoned prototype military gear
- Precious spy intelligence lost by someone

## Places
- Artillery-pocked wasteland
- Reeking refugee camp
- Burnt-out shell of a city
