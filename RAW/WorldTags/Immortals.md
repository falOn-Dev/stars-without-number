# üåê World Tag: Immortals

## Description
Natives of this world are effectively immortal. They may have been gengineered for tremendous lifespans, or have found some local anagathic, or be cyborg life forms, or be so totally convinced of reincarnation that death is a cultural irrelevance. Any immortality technique is likely applicable only to them, or else it‚Äôs apt to be a massive draw to outside imperialists.

- Outsider determined to steal immortality
- Smug local convinced of their immortal wisdom to rule all
- Offworlder seeking the world‚Äôs ruin before it becomes a threat to all

## Friends
- Curious longevity researcher
- Thrill-seeking local
- 

## Complications
- Immortality requires doing something that outsiders can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt willingly do
- The immortality ends if they leave the world
- Death is the punishment for even minor crimes
- Immortals must die or go offworld after a certain span
- Immortality has brutal side-effects

## Things
- Immortality drug

- Toxin that only affects immortals
