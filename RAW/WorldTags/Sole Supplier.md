# üåê World Tag: Sole Supplier

## Description
Some extremely important resource is exported from this world and this world alone. It‚Äôs unlikely that the substance is critical for building spike drives unless this world is also the first to begin interstellar flight, but it may be critical to other high-tech processes or devices. The locals make a large amount of money off this trade and control of it is of critical importance to the planet‚Äôs rulers, and potentially to outside powers.
