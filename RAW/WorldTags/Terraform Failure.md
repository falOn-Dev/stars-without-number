# üåê World Tag: Terraform Failure

## Description
This world was marginal for human habitation when it was discovered, but the Mandate or the early government put in pretech terraforming engines to correct its more extreme qualities. The terraforming did not entirely work, either failing of its own or suffering the destruction of the engines during the Silence. The natives are only partly adapted to the world‚Äôs current state, and struggle with the environment.
## Enemies
- Brutal ruler who cares only for their people
- Offworlder trying to loot the damaged engines
- Warlord trying to seize limited habitable land

## Friends
- Local trying to fix the engines
- Offworlder student of the engines
- World-wise native survivor

## Complications
- The engines produced too much of something instead of too little
- The engines were hijacked by aliens with different preferences
- It was discovered that an Earth-like environment would eventually cause a catastrophic disaster

## Things
- Parts to repair or restore the engines
- Lootable pretech fragments
- Valuable local tech devised to cope with the world

## Places
- Zone of tolerable gravity or temperature
- Native settlement built to cope with the environment
- Massive ruined terraforming engine
