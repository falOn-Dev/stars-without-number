## Description
Natives of this world exist in a kind of mental gestalt, sharing thoughts and partaking of a single identity. Powerful pretech, exotic psionics, alien influence, or some other cause has left the world sharing one identity. Individual members may have greater or lesser degrees of effective coordination with the whole.

## Complications

- The hivemind only happens at particular times
- The world is made of semi-sentient drones and a single AI

## Things
